        <div class="hobbies-card">
          <h3>Reading and writing üìñ</h3>
          <p>Reading and writing is an hobby that i picked up in recent years, that helps keep my mind sharp and also improves and epands my vocabulary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hobbies-card">
          <h3>Gaming üéÆ</h3>
          <p>I honestly can't even consider this an hobby, it's alot more of a passion, i have been playin video games for as long as I can remember, in my opinion a good video game is as good of a story if not better than a regular book, depending on the type of game you choose to play you can  benefit yourself in many diffrent ways including  but not  limited to developing a more Strategic mindset, seeing the world through the eyes of different people or characters that you plays as or generally enjoy  yourself.</p>

        <div class="hobbies-card">
          <h3>Working out üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
          <p>Working out is an hobby that I picked up very recently and it has been far more enjoyable than i innitaly thought. I learned not to long ago that working out releases dopamine and serotonin into your  brain but that isn't the reason I picked it up to  begin with, I saw through the internet and personal exprience how when a person  lets  their body go at an early age (could go up to even 60 years old) how they suffer for it  greatly later in  life in the form of all different kinds of diseases but also through muscle decay, some people dont even have the ability to get up from a sitting position without help.</p>
